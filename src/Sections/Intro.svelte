    Minutes after taking off from Jakarta Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, a Boeing 737-500 crashed into the Java Sea eleven months ago. Enroute to Pontianak on the island of Borneo, Sriwijaya Air Flight 182 left the Indonesian capital during torrential rainfall and low clouds, following a weather delay. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The plane carrying 62 people, including 56 passengers and six crew members, was approved to veer off course to avoid a nearby thunderstorm. According to a <a href="https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20210109-0" target="_blank">preliminary report</a> issued on Feb. 10, recurring issues were discovered with the plane’s autothrottle days beforehand. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The crash killed everyone on board, making it the most fatal aviation accident of 2021. 
  </p>
  <p>
    After evaluating over 24,000 observations of fatal flight crashes in the U.S. from the <a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/Pages/AviationQuery.aspx" target="_blank">NTSB Aviation Query</a>, 19 of the 30 flight crashes with the highest fatality counts were found to happen during lunar phases in close proximity to the new moon. The dataset included crashes of both private planes and commercial jetliners since 1966. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The moon on Jan. 9 – the day Flight 182 left – was illuminated 17% in its <a href="https://www.moongiant.com/phase/1/9/2021" target="_blank">waning crescent phase</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In contrast to the “lunacy” and animalistic behavior often associated with the onset of the full moon, nearly two thirds of the 30 most fatal crashes in America happened [during] the 180 degree lunar transition from third to first quarter – when the moon lurks in darkness.

    The NTSB cites a plethora of reasons, often overlapping in nature, behind flight accidents regardless of the magnitude of the crash. While the <a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/process/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">investigative process</a> does not end with the determination of probable cause, these examinations reveal crucial safety information about each incident. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Accidents are given unique NTSB numbers and the post-investigation findings are listed in final reports, often containing several reasons for the crash in order of occurrence. “Pilot error” is one of the most commonly referenced probable causes, along with in-flight collision’ airframe malfunction and system failure. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Although it isn’t stated as probable cause, the reports often note the weather during the flight, especially if conditions were unfavorable. Layers of factors determined via thorough investigation come together to inform why a plane did not make it to its destination.
  </p>
  <p>
    One thing’s for sure – the phase of the moon on the given day of a crash is not to be found in reports.
  </p>
  <p>
    “You can intuitively think about the new moon as a dark period, when we don’t have as much energy,” said Boston-based astrologer Laura Campagna, who has been conducting tarot readings professionally since 2016. “At the new moon, it’s a time of emptiness and pause and stillness, like shedding and letting go. So before the new moon, you’re emptying out and there’s a lot less energy.”

    The moon is known to affect the ebb and flow of tides, as the closest celestial body to Earth has a strong gravitational pull. But looking to the moon and stars for answers has been around much longer than the buzz it has created in pop culture. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Astrology has become a popularized way for people to seek advice, as astrologers often conduct personalized readings based on an individual’s birth chart, which is believed to be impacted by the alignment and motion of the planets. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Modern “pop astrology became really popular in the US in the 1960s and ‘70s alongside the hippie movement, Americans [were] taking pieces of spirituality from other cultures, as well as an awakening of certain traditions of Greek, Hellenistic and traditional astrology,” said Kai Rosenfield, a practicing astrologer and birth chart reader. 
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition, traditional indigenous Mayan cosmology in Mesoamerica involved conducting spiritual ceremonies to grow and heal crop cycles using a combination of calendars based on the movement of the sun and moon. For example, the 260-day Tzolkin calendar was used to decide when to start sowing seeds, predict the future, and plan dates for battles and big decisions within the community.
